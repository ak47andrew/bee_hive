I'm kinda not in a state to write right now actually... I feel a bit mentally bad and there's a lot of external stuff
going on with my life. I'll drop a devlog as soon as I'll feel like doing it

Also thanks for [guys from battlesnake](https://discord.gg/AkZKCfdkBB) especially `Corey` - all of them added me a huge 
boost in motivation and actually why README.md was changed, why I finished it and shipped it to crates.io in the first 
place. Piece y'all, I'll be back in no time. And I'm surely will be fine, don't worry about me ^^
