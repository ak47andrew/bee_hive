# NEW LIFE TO THE NEW KING... AGAIN

Well, this whole thing will be rewritten in rust! Because last codebase was a huuuge mess.

## Known issues
- You can't use even escaped double quotes in string literals. I'll fix it later
- Something can go wrong if using two arguments in a function. Not sure if it's a bug, but I'll dive into it soon
